# Gridsome Project Showcase

We have worked a lot with Gatsby (ReactJS) and have really had a great experience building web apps and static sites using it , this project is an experiment on using Gridsome (Vue) as a JAM stack alternative. This project is currently in the experiment stage but at the end of it , we want to create a site to demonstrate our ERS github projects and the Open Source initiatives we are undertaking as part of the ERS-HCL organization.
